# What is Liquid

Liquid is a templating language.  This means that we can access data from our shop (e.g product title, collection description, product images or blog posts) and output that directly to our templates. One of the main benefits is that we don't need to have any knowledge of what that data is, we just need to know which variables we have access to in each template.

Liquid uses a combination of tags, objects, and filters to load dynamic content. They are used inside Liquid template files, which are a group of files that make up a theme.
