# What is Liquid

Liquid is a templating language.  This means that we can access data from our shop (e.g product title, collection description, product images or blog posts) and output that directly to our templates. One of the main benefits is that we don't need to have any knowledge of what that data is, we just need to know which variables we have access to in each template.

Liquid uses a combination of tags, objects, and filters to load dynamic content. They are used inside Liquid template files, which are a group of files that make up a theme. 

## Objects

Objects tell Liquid where to show content on a page. Objects and variable names are denoted by double curly braces: ```{{``` and ```}}```.

``` {{ product.Description }} ```

This would output the name of the currently viewed product, for example:

``` Awesome Shoes ```

The output, is simply a case of replacing the placeholder with text from your store.

## Tags

Tags make up the programming logic that tells templates what to do. They are denoted by curly braces and percent signs: ```{%``` and ```%}.```

The markup used in tags does not produce any visible text. This means that you can assign variables and create conditions and loops without showing any of the Liquid logic on the page.

``` 
{% if user %}
  Hello
{% endif %} 
```

In the above example we are controlling the output by using a simple statement. In many ways if statements are like questions.

In the above example if the answer to our if statement question is true we render the words "Hello", if it's false our we won't render anything.

## Filters

Filters are used to modify the output of strings, numbers, variables, and objects. Their purpose is to manipulate the data in some way so that it's format changes. 

``` {{ product.Description | Append: " (SALE!)" }}```

The above would output ``` Awesome Shoes (SALE!) ```, without the filter the (SALE!) text would not be added.
